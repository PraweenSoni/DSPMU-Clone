            university in 2018 under the RUSA Programme has an almost 185 years old legacy that traces back to 1839.
            <br> <br>

            The institution began as a Government English School, through the initiatives of Major J.R. Ousley, the
            British Commissioner of Chhota Nagpur. With the steady expansion of its academic scope and infrastructure,
            it underwent several transitions through gradual upgradation – from Ranchi Zila School in 1875 to a college
            offering intermediate courses in Arts by 1926 under Patna University, Patna. Further evolved into Ranchi
            Government Degree College in 1946 with Shri KP Sinha as its Principal. Rechristened as Ranchi College,
            Ranchi In 1949, the institution became a constituent unit of Bihar University in 1952. The academic gallop
            of the institution continued further from 1951-52 when Post-graduate teaching started and there was no
